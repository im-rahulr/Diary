            <p>Survived another round of Zoom meetings today. Three hours of my life I'll never get back, but at least I've perfected the art of looking engaged while actually daydreaming about my next vacation.</p>
            
            <p>The highlight was when Jim forgot he wasn't on mute and had a full conversation with his cat about dinner plans. Everyone pretended not to notice, but the chat was exploding with cat emojis.</p>
            
            <p>Sarah's virtual background glitched again, causing her head to repeatedly disappear and reappear throughout her presentation. Somehow made her points about quarterly projections much more interesting.</p>
            
            <p>Made a game of counting how many times the boss said "circle back" (final tally: 17). Small victories keep me going.</p>
