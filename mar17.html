            <p>🤔 Hmm, where do I start?</p>
            <p>This journey began 2 or 3 months ago, but now, within just 2 months, I have seen many faces in college. I’ve witnessed teachers' anger 😡, made friends 🤝, and bunked classes together 😆. Some people came as pairs from Malur 👫 but lost their partners 💔 and found new ones. Some joined BCA because of their friends, parents, or lovers ❤️.</p>
        <p>This is just the beginning of our 3-year stay. Stay tuned as we expose all the secrets 🔥 and document the Lowry life! 📖</p>
