            <p>Contemplating life's mysteries, like why do we press harder on the remote control when we know the batteries are weak? It's as if we believe our extra force will somehow transfer energy into the dying batteries.</p>
            
            <p>Also wondered why we have eyebrows. Besides the obvious function of keeping sweat out of our eyes, they're strangely expressive. Entire conversations can happen with just eyebrow movements.</p>
            
            <p>Noticed how we all pretend to read the terms and conditions but just scroll to the bottom and click "I agree." What if there's something important in there? What if one day they slip in "you agree to give us your firstborn child" and we just casually accept it?</p>
            
            <p>And why do we open the refrigerator multiple times hoping food will magically appear? As if the fridge fairy will deliver snacks between our checks.</p>
